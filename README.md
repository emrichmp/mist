# mist

## Welcome!
mist is a React/Redux/Thunk frontend app that pulls from "some" API. The function of mist is to show you the weather and additionally tell the user a clothing recommendation. Goal of mist is to be a beautiful and aesthetic way for users to see the weather.

Additionally mist is another way for me to practice my React/Redux/Thunk.
